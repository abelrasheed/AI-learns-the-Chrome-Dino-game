# AI-learns-the-Chrome-Dino-game
In this project, ive trained a simple neural network using a simplified version of the genetic algorithm to make it learn an imitation of google chrome's dinosaur game.

NOTE : All the images used in this project are downloaded from the internet, i do not have ownership of any png or jpeg files in this project.

The dinosaur object is declared using the Dino class in the file dino.js
The plants object is declared using the plants class in the file plants.js
matrix.js provides the functionality to do the mathematical computation using matrices.
neural_net.js provides the functionality to actually use the neural networks.
evolution.js contains the code for genetic algorithm
sketch.js is the main file.

if you're interested in looking into the plain game without any kind of machine learning involved, find it here https://github.com/abelrasheed/Dino-Game

The genetic algorithm as of now can be improved in many ways, adding a cross-over functionality, or using NEATS algorithm, which is much more advanced,
